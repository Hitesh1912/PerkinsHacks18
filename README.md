Platform requirements
The program was developed for Windows 10, iOS and Python 3.3+.

## Pyttsx text to speech
Pytsx is a cross-platform text-to-speech wrapper.
It uses different speech engines based on your operating system:
nsss – NSSpeechSynthesizer on Mac OS X 10.5 and higher
sapi5 – SAPI5 on Windows XP, Windows Vista, and (untested) Windows 7
espeak – eSpeak on any distro / platform that can host the shared library (e.g., Ubuntu / Fedora Linux)

## Install with pip (using pyenv, pipenv or virtualenv):
`sudo pip install pyttsx`
## Have pip installed and run
` pip install pywin32 `  (for win32com.client)

# <a name="get_api_key"></a>Get API Key
Subscribe to the Speech Recognition API, and get a free trial subscription key.
The Speech API is part of Cognitive Services (previously Project Oxford). You can get free trial subscription keys from the Cognitive Services subscription page. After you select the Speech API, select Get API Key to get the key. It returns a primary and secondary key. Both keys are tied to the same quota, so you can use either key.
Enter API KEY in the space for api_key in the code.

# <a name="run_the_sample_application"></a>Run the sample application
After the installing the different libraries, execute the python program.
ex `python program.py`

# <a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion
At the end we were able to know about the services available to visually impaired people, what their feedback was and came up with a way to improve existing products to suit their needs.
